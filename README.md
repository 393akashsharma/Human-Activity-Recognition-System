## Overview

This project aims to recognize human actions from images using various feature extraction methods combined with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. It includes implementations using:

- Grayscale image vectorization
- Combined SIFT and HOG features
- SIFT, HOG, and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features
- VGG16 deep learning feature extraction

Each method is evaluated based on classification accuracy and performance metrics.
